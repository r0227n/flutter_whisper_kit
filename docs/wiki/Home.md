# Flutter WhisperKit Apple

Flutter WhisperKit Apple is a Flutter plugin that provides an interface between Flutter applications and Apple's WhisperKit framework for on-device speech recognition. This plugin enables Flutter developers to implement speech-to-text functionality in their iOS and macOS applications without writing native code themselves.

## Overview

The plugin handles audio input processing, communication with native WhisperKit libraries, and returns transcription results back to the Flutter application in a developer-friendly format.

### Target Audience

Users of this plugin are Flutter developers who need to incorporate audio transcription capabilities in their applications targeting Apple platforms.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several core systems:

1. **Flutter API Layer**: Dart code that provides a clean, easy-to-use interface for Flutter applications.
2. **Platform Channel Communication**: The bridge between Dart code and native Apple platform code.
3. **Native Implementation**: iOS/macOS Swift code that interfaces with Apple's WhisperKit framework.
4. **Example Application**: Demonstrates the usage of the plugin with sample code.
