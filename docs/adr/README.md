# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Flutter WhisperKit project. ADRs document important architectural decisions made during the development process, including the context, reasoning, and consequences of each decision.

## What are ADRs?

Architecture Decision Records are short documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They help teams:

- **Document reasoning**: Understand why decisions were made
- **Share knowledge**: Communicate architectural decisions to team members
- **Track evolution**: See how the architecture has evolved over time
- **Avoid repetition**: Prevent re-litigating already-decided issues
- **Onboard new team members**: Provide context for architectural choices

## ADR Format

Each ADR follows a consistent format:

- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: Background and problem description
- **Decision**: What was decided and how it will be implemented
- **Rationale**: Why this decision was made
- **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes
- **Related ADRs**: Links to related decisions

## Current ADRs

### [ADR-001: Error Handling Strategy](001-error-handling-strategy.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-29

Establishes the Result Pattern approach for error handling, providing better type safety and explicit error handling compared to traditional exception-throwing methods.

**Key Decisions**:
- Implement Result&lt;Success, Failure&gt; pattern
- Dual API approach (traditional + Result-based)
- Standardized error codes by category
- Error recovery mechanisms

**Impact**: Improved reliability and developer experience for error handling.

### [ADR-002: Platform Abstraction](002-platform-abstraction.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-29

Defines the platform abstraction layer for supporting multiple Apple platforms (iOS/macOS) with a unified API while enabling platform-specific optimizations.

**Key Decisions**:
- Platform Interface Pattern implementation
- Federated plugin architecture
- Platform capability system
- Unified error propagation

**Impact**: Enables multi-platform support with optimized platform-specific implementations.

### [ADR-003: Testing Approach](003-testing-approach.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-29

Establishes comprehensive testing strategy with standardized utilities, multi-layer testing pyramid, and Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices.

**Key Decisions**:
- 70% unit tests, 20% integration tests, 10% E2E tests
- Standardized mock utilities and test data factories
- TDD workflow implementation
- Result pattern testing strategies

**Impact**: High confidence in code quality and easier maintenance through comprehensive testing.

### [ADR-004: Stream Management](004-stream-management.md)
**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: 2024-12-29

Implements reactive stream architecture for real-time audio processing with buffering, backpressure handling, and proper resource management.

**Key Decisions**:
- Reactive stream architecture
- Multiple buffering strategies
- Event-driven architecture
- Memory management and cleanup

**Impact**: Responsive real-time features with efficient resource usage.

## Decision Process

### When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:

- Affect the overall architecture
- Have long-term implications
- Involve trade-offs between alternatives
- Need to be communicated to the team
- Might be questioned or revisited later

### ADR Lifecycle

1. **Proposed**: Initial draft for discussion
2. **Accepted**: Decision approved and implemented
3. **Deprecated**: Decision is outdated but not replaced
4. **Superseded**: Decision replaced by a newer ADR

### Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template from `template.md`
2. Use the next available number (ADR-005, ADR-006, etc.)
3. Fill in all sections with relevant information
4. Create a pull request for review
5. Update this README to include the new ADR

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXX]

## Date
YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
[Describe the problem and its context]

## Decision
[Describe the decision and implementation]

## Rationale
[Explain why this decision was made]

## Consequences
[List positive and negative consequences]

## Related ADRs
[Links to related decisions]

## References
[External references and documentation]
```
