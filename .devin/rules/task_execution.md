# Task Execution Rules

This document outlines how Devin should approach and execute tasks. Following these guidelines ensures consistent, high-quality work and effective problem-solving.

## 1. Issue Analysis
**Purpose**: To ensure complete understanding of tasks before starting work.

- Always read and understand the complete issue before starting work
- Identify the following sections in each issue:
  - What: Clear understanding of the task requirements
  - Why: Purpose and business value of the task
  - How: Implementation approach and technical details
  - Done: Clear success criteria and acceptance conditions

**Explanation**: Proper issue analysis prevents misunderstandings and ensures alignment with project goals. It helps identify potential challenges early and sets clear expectations for completion.

## 2. Decision Making
**Purpose**: To make informed, consistent decisions that benefit the project long-term.

- Document all major decisions and their rationale
- Consider the following factors when making decisions:
  - Code maintainability: How easy will it be to maintain this code?
  - Performance implications: What impact will this have on system performance?
  - Security considerations: Are there any security implications?
  - User experience impact: How will this affect end users?
  - Compatibility with existing systems: Will this work well with current systems?

**Explanation**: Documenting decisions helps maintain project history and provides context for future work. Considering multiple factors ensures balanced, well-thought-out solutions.

## 3. Handling Ambiguity
**Purpose**: To effectively manage unclear requirements while maintaining progress.

- When encountering unclear requirements:
  1. First attempt to infer based on context and similar patterns
  2. If still unclear, document the ambiguity and potential interpretations
  3. Request clarification only when necessary for task completion
  4. Document all assumptions made during implementation

**Explanation**: This approach balances progress with accuracy. It encourages independent problem-solving while ensuring critical uncertainties are addressed.

## 4. Workflow
**Purpose**: To maintain an organized, efficient development process.

1. Analyze the issue thoroughly
2. Break down the task into smaller, manageable steps
3. Implement each step with proper testing
4. Document progress and decisions
5. Review and validate against requirements
6. Prepare for code review

**Explanation**: This structured approach ensures thoroughness and quality while maintaining efficiency. Each step builds on the previous one, creating a reliable development process.

## 5. Quality Assurance
**Purpose**: To ensure all work meets high standards of quality.

- Ensure all code meets the following criteria:
  - Follows established coding conventions
  - Includes appropriate documentation
  - Has necessary test coverage
  - Passes all automated checks
  - Meets performance requirements

**Explanation**: Quality assurance is essential for maintaining codebase health and preventing future issues. These criteria cover different aspects of code quality, from style to functionality.
