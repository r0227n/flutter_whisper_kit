# Development Workflow

1. **Initial Planning & Documentation**  
   Once the scope of your work is clear, create the following documentation files in the directory you will be working in:
   - `README-ja_JP.md`: Describe the purpose and structure of the directory **in Japanese**.
   - `README-en_US.md`: Describe the purpose and structure of the directory **in English**.

   After completing these README files, commit them.

2. **Implement the Program**  
   Update the program based on the contents described in the README files.  
   Follow the commit guidelines strictly while making changes.

3. **Write and Run Tests**  
   After implementing the code changes, create and run **tests** that validate your modifications.  
   If no relevant tests exist, write new ones to cover your implementation.

4. **Test Completion**  
   Ensure that **all tests pass** successfully. Only then consider the task complete.

Let me know if you'd like me to draft the initial structure for the README files as well!
