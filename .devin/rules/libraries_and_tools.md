# Libraries and Tools Policy

This document outlines the approved libraries, tools, and development practices. Following these guidelines ensures consistency, security, and maintainability across the project.

## 1. Approved Libraries

### Core Libraries
**Purpose**: To establish the foundation of the application with reliable, well-maintained libraries.

- React for UI development
- TypeScript for type safety
- Jest for testing
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting

**Explanation**: These core libraries provide a solid foundation for development, with strong community support and regular updates.

### Utility Libraries
**Purpose**: To provide common functionality through well-tested, efficient libraries.

- Lodash for utility functions
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Moment.js for date handling
- React Query for data fetching
- Formik for form handling

**Explanation**: Utility libraries help reduce development time and ensure consistent implementation of common functionality.

### UI Libraries
**Purpose**: To maintain a consistent, accessible, and responsive user interface.

- Material-UI for components
- Styled-components for styling
- React Router for navigation
- React Hook Form for forms
- React Testing Library for UI testing

**Explanation**: These UI libraries help maintain a consistent look and feel while ensuring accessibility and responsiveness.

## 2. Prohibited Libraries
**Purpose**: To prevent the use of problematic or unnecessary libraries.

- Libraries with known security vulnerabilities
- Libraries with poor maintenance
- Duplicate functionality libraries
- Libraries with incompatible licenses
- Libraries with performance issues

**Explanation**: Avoiding problematic libraries helps maintain code quality, security, and performance.

## 3. Development Tools

### Code Quality
**Purpose**: To maintain high code quality through automated tools.

- ESLint configuration
- Prettier configuration
- TypeScript configuration
- Husky for git hooks
- Commitlint for commit messages

**Explanation**: These tools help enforce coding standards and catch issues early in the development process.

### Testing Tools
**Purpose**: To ensure comprehensive testing coverage.

- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for E2E testing
- React Testing Library
- Mock Service Worker
- Coverage reporting tools

**Explanation**: A comprehensive testing toolkit helps ensure code reliability and catch issues before they reach production.

### CI/CD Tools
**Purpose**: To automate the build, test, and deployment process.

- GitHub Actions
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- SonarQube for code quality
- Jenkins for automation

**Explanation**: CI/CD tools help maintain a reliable and efficient development pipeline.

## 4. Version Management
**Purpose**: To ensure consistent and secure dependency management.

- Use specific versions in package.json
- Document version requirements
- Update dependencies regularly
- Test before updating
- Maintain changelog

**Explanation**: Proper version management prevents compatibility issues and security vulnerabilities.

## 5. Security Considerations
**Purpose**: To maintain secure coding practices and prevent vulnerabilities.

- Regular security audits
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secure coding practices
- Access control implementation
- Data encryption standards

**Explanation**: Security considerations help protect the application and its users from potential threats.

## 6. Performance Tools
**Purpose**: To monitor and optimize application performance.

- Lighthouse for performance
- Webpack Bundle Analyzer
- Chrome DevTools
- Performance monitoring
- Memory leak detection

**Explanation**: Performance tools help identify and resolve performance issues before they affect users.

## 7. Documentation Tools
**Purpose**: To maintain comprehensive and up-to-date documentation.

- Storybook for components
- JSDoc for documentation
- Swagger for API docs
- Markdown for general docs
- Diagram tools for architecture

**Explanation**: Good documentation tools help maintain clear and accessible documentation for the project.
