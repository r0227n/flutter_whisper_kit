# Edge Cases and Decision Rules

This document provides guidance for handling ambiguous situations and making consistent decisions. These rules help maintain code quality and project consistency.

## 1. Bug vs Specification
**Purpose**: To distinguish between actual bugs and intended behavior changes.

- Bug: Deviation from documented behavior
- Specification: Intended behavior change
- Decision criteria:
  - Check documentation
  - Review requirements
  - Consider user impact
  - Evaluate consistency
  - Assess severity

**Explanation**: Clear distinction between bugs and specifications helps prioritize work and maintain system integrity.

## 2. Code Consistency
**Purpose**: To maintain consistent code patterns and practices.

- Follow existing patterns
- Document deviations
- Consider refactoring
- Maintain readability
- Preserve functionality

**Explanation**: Consistent code is easier to maintain and understand, reducing cognitive load for developers.

## 3. Error Handling
**Purpose**: To ensure robust and user-friendly error handling.

- Define error types
- Document error scenarios
- Implement graceful degradation
- Provide user feedback
- Log error details

**Explanation**: Proper error handling improves user experience and makes debugging easier.

## 4. Performance Considerations
**Purpose**: To balance performance with code quality and maintainability.

- Set performance thresholds
- Monitor resource usage
- Optimize critical paths
- Consider scalability
- Document trade-offs

**Explanation**: Performance optimization should be balanced with other factors like code clarity and maintainability.

## 5. Security Decisions
**Purpose**: To maintain secure coding practices and prevent vulnerabilities.

- Follow security best practices
- Implement least privilege
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize outputs
- Log security events

**Explanation**: Security should be considered in all aspects of development to protect the application and its users.

## 6. User Experience
**Purpose**: To ensure a positive and consistent user experience.

- Consider accessibility
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Provide clear feedback
- Maintain consistency
- Document user flows

**Explanation**: Good user experience is essential for user satisfaction and adoption.

## 7. Technical Debt
**Purpose**: To manage and prioritize technical debt effectively.

- Document technical debt
- Set priorities
- Plan refactoring
- Consider impact
- Track progress

**Explanation**: Proper management of technical debt helps maintain code quality and prevent future issues.

## 8. Dependency Management
**Purpose**: To maintain secure and efficient dependency management.

- Evaluate dependencies
- Consider alternatives
- Document decisions
- Monitor updates
- Plan migrations

**Explanation**: Careful dependency management prevents security vulnerabilities and compatibility issues.

## 9. Testing Strategy
**Purpose**: To ensure comprehensive and effective testing.

- Define test coverage
- Identify critical paths
- Plan test scenarios
- Document assumptions
- Review test results

**Explanation**: A well-planned testing strategy helps catch issues early and maintain code quality.

## 10. Documentation Requirements
**Purpose**: To maintain clear and up-to-date documentation.

- Document decisions
- Explain rationale
- Update documentation
- Maintain consistency
- Review regularly

**Explanation**: Good documentation helps new team members understand the system and maintain code quality.
