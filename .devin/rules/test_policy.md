# Test Policy

This document outlines the testing requirements and procedures that ensure code quality and reliability. Following these guidelines helps maintain a robust and maintainable codebase.

## 1. Test Types and Requirements

### Unit Tests
**Purpose**: To verify individual components work correctly in isolation.

- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover all public methods
- Include edge cases and error conditions
- Minimum coverage: 80%

**Explanation**: Unit tests provide fast feedback and help catch issues early in development. They're essential for maintaining code quality and enabling safe refactoring.

### Integration Tests
**Purpose**: To verify components work together correctly.

- Test component interactions
- Use real dependencies where appropriate
- Test API endpoints
- Verify data flow between components
- Include error scenarios

**Explanation**: Integration tests catch issues that unit tests might miss by testing how components interact with each other and external systems.

### UI Tests
**Purpose**: To ensure the user interface works as expected.

- Test user interactions
- Verify visual elements
- Test responsive design
- Include accessibility tests
- Test form validations

**Explanation**: UI tests help ensure a good user experience by verifying that the interface behaves correctly and is accessible to all users.

## 2. Test Data Management
**Purpose**: To maintain reliable and consistent test data.

- Use consistent test data
- Keep test data separate from production
- Document test data requirements
- Include data cleanup procedures
- Version control test data

**Explanation**: Proper test data management ensures tests are reliable and reproducible, while preventing accidental data leaks or corruption.

## 3. Test Organization
**Purpose**: To maintain well-structured and maintainable tests.

- Follow test naming conventions
- Group related tests
- Use descriptive test names
- Include test categories
- Document test dependencies

**Explanation**: Well-organized tests are easier to maintain and understand, making it simpler to update them as requirements change.

## 4. Test Documentation
**Purpose**: To ensure tests are well-documented and understandable.

- Document test purpose
- Explain test setup
- Document expected results
- Include test assumptions
- Document test limitations

**Explanation**: Good documentation helps other developers understand the purpose and scope of tests, making it easier to maintain and update them.

## 5. Test Maintenance
**Purpose**: To keep tests relevant and effective.

- Keep tests up-to-date
- Remove obsolete tests
- Refactor tests when needed
- Update tests for new features
- Review test coverage regularly

**Explanation**: Regular maintenance ensures tests remain valuable and don't become a burden to the development process.

## 6. Test Environment
**Purpose**: To ensure consistent and reliable test execution.

- Use consistent environments
- Document environment setup
- Include environment variables
- Handle environment differences
- Test in multiple environments

**Explanation**: Consistent test environments help prevent environment-specific issues and ensure tests are reliable across different setups.

## 7. Test Reporting
**Purpose**: To provide clear visibility into test results and coverage.

- Generate test reports
- Track test metrics
- Document test failures
- Include test duration
- Report test coverage

**Explanation**: Clear reporting helps identify issues quickly and track the overall health of the test suite.
