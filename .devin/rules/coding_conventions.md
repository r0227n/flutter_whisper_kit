# Coding Conventions

This document establishes the coding standards and best practices that Devin should follow. These conventions ensure code consistency, readability, and maintainability across the project.

## 1. Naming Conventions
**Purpose**: To create clear, consistent, and meaningful names that improve code readability.

- Use descriptive, meaningful names for all identifiers
- Follow language-specific conventions:
  - Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `UserService`)
  - Methods and variables: camelCase (e.g., `getUserData`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
  - Private members: _prefix for private fields (e.g., `_internalState`)
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely accepted

**Explanation**: Consistent naming makes code easier to read and understand. It helps developers quickly identify the purpose and scope of different code elements.

## 2. Code Structure
**Purpose**: To maintain clean, manageable code that's easy to navigate and modify.

- Maximum file length: 500 lines
- Maximum method length: 20 lines
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Group related code together
- Separate concerns into different files/classes

**Explanation**: These limits prevent code from becoming unwieldy and difficult to maintain. They encourage modular design and clear separation of concerns.

## 3. Documentation
**Purpose**: To ensure code is well-documented and easy to understand for other developers.

- Document all public APIs
- Include method purpose, parameters, and return values
- Use clear, concise comments for complex logic
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Document any non-obvious decisions or workarounds

**Explanation**: Good documentation reduces the learning curve for new developers and helps maintain code quality over time. It's especially important for public APIs that other developers will use.

## 4. Code Organization
**Purpose**: To maintain a logical and consistent project structure.

- Follow the project's directory structure
- Group related files in appropriate directories
- Keep test files alongside source files
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Use appropriate design patterns

**Explanation**: Well-organized code is easier to navigate and maintain. It helps developers quickly find what they need and understand how different parts of the system work together.

## 5. Style Guidelines
**Purpose**: To ensure consistent code formatting and style across the project.

- Use consistent brace style
- Add appropriate spacing around operators
- Use meaningful whitespace
- Follow language-specific best practices
- Use appropriate access modifiers

**Explanation**: Consistent style makes code more readable and reduces cognitive load when switching between different parts of the codebase.

## 6. Error Handling
**Purpose**: To ensure robust and user-friendly error handling throughout the application.

- Use appropriate exception types
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Handle errors at appropriate levels
- Log errors with sufficient context
- Clean up resources in finally blocks

**Explanation**: Proper error handling improves application stability and makes debugging easier. It also provides better user experience when things go wrong.

## 7. Performance Considerations
**Purpose**: To write efficient code that performs well under various conditions.

- Avoid premature optimization
- Use appropriate data structures
- Minimize memory allocations
- Consider time complexity
- Profile performance-critical code

**Explanation**: While performance is important, it should be balanced with code clarity and maintainability. These guidelines help make informed decisions about performance optimization.
